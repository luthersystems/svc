# A golang module proxy server can greatly help speed up docker builds but the
# official proxy at https://proxy.golang.org only works for public modules.
# When your application needs private go module dependencies consider running a
# local athens-proxy server with an ssh/http configuration which can access
# private source repositories, otherwise set GOPRIVATE (or GONOPROXY and
# GONOSUMDB) if private modules are needed.  Though be aware that GOPRIVATE
# requires credentials (e.g. for github ssh) be available during builds which
# complicates things considerably.
